### Running StoryBook

StoryBook is used for component development and testing in isolation. Follow these steps to work with StoryBook:

1. Start the StoryBook development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm run storybook
   ```

2. Create story files for components:

   - Each component must have a `[component-name].stories.tsx` file in the same directory
   - Follow the naming convention: `Button.stories.tsx` for `Button.tsx`
   - Stories should showcase different states and variations of the component

3. Basic story file structure:

   ```tsx
   import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';
   import { ComponentName } from './ComponentName';

   const meta: Meta<typeof ComponentName> = {
     title: 'UI/ComponentName',
     component: ComponentName,
   };

   export default meta;
   type Story = StoryObj<typeof ComponentName>;

   export const Default: Story = {
     args: {
       // Component props
     },
   };
   ```

4. Best practices:

   - Include multiple stories for different component states
   - Add documentation using JSDoc comments
   - Test edge cases and error states
   - Use controls to make props interactive
   - Add accessibility tests where applicable

5. Build static StoryBook (for deployment):
   ```bash
   pnpm run build-storybook
   ```
