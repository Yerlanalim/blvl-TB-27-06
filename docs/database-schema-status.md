### Execution Date
July 1, 2025

### Status: 95% COMPLETE ✅

---

## Database Integrity Validation

### ✅ Basic Prisma Validation

npx prisma validate    # PASSED ✅
npx prisma format      # PASSED ✅  
npx prisma generate    # PASSED ✅
```

**Result**: Schema syntax is valid and Prisma Client generates successfully.

---

## Critical Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: StatsReport Type Mismatch  
**Problem**: `getUserReports()` used `include: { questions: {...} }` but schema defined `linkedReports`
**Solution**: Updated `src/utils/data/statistics/reports/get-reports.ts` to use `questions` instead of `linkedReports`
**Status**: FIXED

### ✅ Issue 2: RoadmapQuestionContext Type Error
**Problem**: `setNewUserData` expected `RoadmapUserQuestionsAnswers` but received `RoadmapUserQuestionsUserAnswers`
**Solution**: Updated interface in `src/contexts/roadmap-question-context.tsx` to use correct type `RoadmapUserQuestionsUserAnswers`  
**Status**: FIXED

### ✅ Issue 3: Import Path Errors
**Problem**: Incorrect import paths for `generateAnswerHelp` and `answerHelpSchema`
**Solution**: Fixed imports to use correct paths:
- `@/actions/ai/questions/answer-help` 
- `@/lib/zod/schemas/ai/answer-help`
**Status**: FIXED

### ✅ Issue 4: Unused Import (ESLint)
**Problem**: `RoadmapUserQuestionsAnswers` imported but unused
**Solution**: Removed unused import from roadmap-question-context.tsx
**Status**: FIXED

---

## Remaining Issues

### ⚠️ Issue 5: Type Compatibility in Layout
**File**: `src/app/(app)/(roadmap)/roadmap/[roadmapUid]/[uid]/layout.tsx:58`
**Problem**: `RoadmapUserQuestions` missing `answers` property with correct type structure
**Error**: Type mismatch where `answers` expected with `order` field but receiving without
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - 1 remaining TypeScript error
